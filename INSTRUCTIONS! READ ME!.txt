Where certain files are, what they do and which ones to edit: 

-In the folder "img" is where all the images for the site should be kept. 
	There are subfolders within here to organise the different categories of food. 

-In the folder "pages" is where you will find the files that are the catgorized pages on the website. 
	Here is the files you can edit to add, take off or edit items on the menu.
	Find the category you need to find for example to add a new jucie flavour go and edit the "frozen.html" file.

- In the folder "backup" is a copy of the website in a state that works.
	If a large mistake is bad the site can be restored to its previous state by copying all the files in "backup" in to the main directory and overwriting ALL when the prompt asks.
